Notes

  •For a smooth spiral, keep depht/frequency/speed the same as height/frequency/speed
  •Performance notes:
		Try to keep all unused variables to 0
		Use rotate instead of Sine Speeds if possible
		"runOnceThenDisable" turns off the spiral generation, big performance gain (rotation and material animation still works)
	•Creating a new spiral:
		Use an existing prefab
		Press play
		Change the variables while in play mode (remember to turn off "runOnceThenDisable" before pressing play)
		When the spiral looks like it is suppose to, drag it from Hierarchy to Project folder
		Drag the prefab from Project to Hierarcy
		Assign start and end targets
		Delete the old spiral from Hierarcy if needed
	•Creating a multi spiral:
		Create or use a existing spiral prefab
		Use a premade multiSpiral prefab or attach the multiSpiral script to a empty gameObject
		Set how many spirals the multiSpiral should spawn in the "spiralWithRotationArray" 
		Assign the spirals to each index of the array
